##Simple Online Food Ordering application - "CLICK TO EAT"


## 1. Introduction
The  click to eat app is a web-based application that allows users to order food Online.
This documentation provides an overview of the application, its features, and the technologies used to build it.

## 2. Technologies Used
The click to eat app is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The following technologies and tools are used:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used for building the server-side application.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- npm: A package manager for managing application dependencies.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for user authentication and authorization.
- bcrypt.js: A library used for hashing and salting passwords.

## 3. System Architecture
The click to eat app follows a client-server architecture.
The client-side of the application is built using React.js,which interacts with the server-side API built using Express.js and Node.js,
The server communicates with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.

## 4. Installation and Setup
To run the click to eat app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd Click to Eat`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file and add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection URL, JWT secret key).
5. Start the development server: `npm start`
6. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.



## 5. User Authentication and Authorization
User authentication and authorization are implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
When a user registers or logs in, a JWT is generated and sent back to the client. 
The client includes this token in the request headers for subsequent API requests that require authentication.

## 6. Error Handling
Errors and exceptions are handled throughout the application. 
The server responds with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in JSON format.
The client displays error messages to the user based on the received responses.

## 7. Conclusion
This documentation provides an overview of the click to eat app built using the MERN stack. 
It covers the technologies used, system architecture, installation instructions,user authentication, error handling.
Use this documentation as a reference to understand the application's structure and functionality.
